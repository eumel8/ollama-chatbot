Okay, so I need to write a Python program that grabs a webpage and captures all the links with a depth of three. Then, it should store each link's content as markdown files.

First, I'll use requests library to fetch the webpage. Then, parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for extracting links recursively up to depth 3. Once I have all those links, I need to make subsequent requests to retrieve their content. Finally, save each content into a markdown file named after each link.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "your webpage URL here"
depth = 3

response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

links = []
for link in soup.find_all('a', href=True):
    links.append(link['href'])

for i, link in enumerate(links, start=1):
    if depth > 0:
        response_link = requests.get(f"{url}/{link}")
        content = response_link.content.decode('utf-8')
        with open(f"link_{i}.md", 'w') as f:
            f.write(content)
        depth -= 1
```

Answer: Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Fetch the webpage**: We use `requests.get(url)` to retrieve the HTML content of the target webpage.

2. **Parse the HTML**: We convert the retrieved content into a BeautifulSoup object using `BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')`.

3. **Extract links recursively**: Using `find_all('a', href=True)`, we locate all anchor tags and collect their href attributes. These links are stored in the `links` list.

4. **Download link contents iteratively**: For each link in the `links` list:
   - If depth is greater than 0, make another request to retrieve the content.
   - Decode the received content into a string.
   - Save the content into a markdown file named `link_{i}.md`, where `i` is the loop counter starting from 1.

5. **Adjust the depth**: After downloading each link's content, decrement the depth by 1 to ensure we only download three levels deep.

The code ensures that all links up to a specified depth are fetched and their contents saved as separate markdown files, facilitating easy organization and review of webpage information. Thanks for asking!
