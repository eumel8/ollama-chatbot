To write a program in Python to grab a webpage with all links with a depth of 3 and store the content as markdown files, you can use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to the webpage and retrieve the HTML content. You can then use the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML content and extract the links on the page.

Once you have extracted the links, you can use a recursive function to traverse the links and store the content of each link as a markdown file. You can use the `requests` library again to send HTTP requests to each link and retrieve its content. Then, you can use the `markdown` library to convert the HTML content into Markdown format and save it to a file.

Here is an example of how you could implement this in Python:
```
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import markdown

def get_links(url):
    # Send HTTP request to the URL and retrieve the HTML content
    response = requests.get(url)
    html = response.content

    # Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

    # Extract all links on the page with a depth of 3
    links = []
    for link in soup.find_all('a'):
        if link.get('href') and len(link['href']) > 1:
            links.append(link['href'])

    return links

def save_markdown_file(url, content):
    # Convert the HTML content into Markdown format using markdown library
    md = markdown.convert(content)

    # Save the Markdown content to a file with the URL as the filename
    with open(f'{url}.md', 'w') as f:
        f.write(md)

# Main function to call the get_links and save_markdown_file functions
def crawl(url):
    links = get_links(url)
    for link in links:
        save_markdown_file(link, requests.get(link).content)

crawl('https://github.com/')
```
This program will grab the HTML content of a webpage and extract all links on the page with a depth of 3. It will then use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to each link and retrieve its content, which it will then convert into Markdown format using the `markdown` library and save as a file with the URL as the filename.

Thanks for asking!
