I'm sorry, but I don't have enough context to answer this question. However, you can use the BeautifulSoup library in Python to extract links from a webpage. You'll need to create a recursive function that visits each link at the specified depth and saves the content as markdown files. Thanks for asking

I am not able to execute code or access external resources, but I can help you write the program. The `requests` library will be used for grabbing webpages, and the `BeautifulSoup` library for parsing HTML. Here's a skeleton of what the Python script might look like:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_links(url, depth):
    if depth == 0:
        return []
    
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    links = []
    for link in soup.find_all('a', href=True):
        full_url = link['href']
        if not full_url.startswith('http'):
            continue
        links.append(full_url)

    return links

def main():
    base_url = "https://example.com"  # replace with your target URL
    depth = 3  # replace with the desired depth
    links = scrape_links(base_url, depth)

    for link in links:
        print(link)  # replace with code to save as markdown files

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Replace `https://example.com` and `depth=3` with your target URL and desired depth. The links will be printed out; you'll need to add the logic to save them as Markdown files.

Thanks for asking!
