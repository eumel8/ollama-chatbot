not wrong, but ignore the question (no external traffic)
second try does not work

You can use the `kubectl` command-line tool to list all pods in a Kubernetes cluster. Here is an example of how to do
this using the `kubectl get` command:
```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
This will display a list of all pods in the current namespace, along with their names, statuses, and other relevant
information. The `-o wide` flag tells `kubectl` to display additional columns of information, such as the pod's IP
address and the name of its node.

Alternatively, you can use the `kubectl get` command with a different flag to view only the names of the pods:
```
kubectl get pods -o name
```
This will display a list of all pods in the current namespace, along with their names. You can also filter the list by
using other flags, such as `-l` to specify a label selector or `--field-selector` to specify a field selector. For
example:
```
kubectl get pods -l app=myapp
```
This will display a list of all pods in the current namespace that have the `app` label set to `myapp`.

You can also use other tools, such as `helm list` or `kustomize`, to list all pods in a Kubernetes cluster. These tools
provide different ways to view and manage the resources in your cluster, and may be more suitable for certain use cases.

second question to start programming:

To use the Go client library to query the list of Pods in a Kubernetes cluster, you can follow these steps:

1. First, create a new Go project using your preferred method (e.g., `go mod init`).
2. Install the Kubernetes client-go library by running the following command:
```
go get k8s.io/client-go@v15.3.0
```
This will download and install the client-go library into your Go project.
3. Next, create a new file called `main.go` in your project directory, and add the following code:
```
package main

import (
        "context"
        "fmt"
        "os"

        metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
        "k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes"
        _ "k8s.io/client-go/plugin/pkg/client/auth/gcp"
)

func main() {
        // Create a new Kubernetes client for the current context
        clientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(rest.InClusterConfig())
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Println("Error creating Kubernetes client:", err)
                os.Exit(1)
        }

        // Get the list of Pods in the current namespace
        podList, err := clientset.CoreV1().Pods("").List(context.Background(), metav1.ListOptions{})
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Println("Error retrieving Pod list:", err)
                os.Exit(1)
        }

        // Print the list of Pods
        for _, pod := range podList.Items {
                fmt.Printf("%s (%s)\n", pod.Name, pod.Status.Phase)
        }
}
```
This code creates a new Kubernetes client for the current context using the `kubernetes` package, and then uses the
`CoreV1()` function to get a list of Pods in the current namespace. The `List()` function is used to retrieve the list
of Pods, and the `metav1.ListOptions{}` struct is used to specify no additional options for the query.

Once the list of Pods has been retrieved, the code prints each Pod's name followed by its status (e.g., "Running",
"Succeeded", etc.).

Note that this code uses the `k8s.io/client-go` library to interact with the Kubernetes API, and may require additional
configuration or authentication depending on your environment. You can find more information about how to use the
client-go library in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/).
