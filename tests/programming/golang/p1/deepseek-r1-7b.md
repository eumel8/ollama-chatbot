Okay, so the user wants to write a Go program that lists all pods in a Kubernetes cluster. I remember from the context provided that there's a GitHub repository with some relevant files.

First, I should check if the user provided any links related to listing pods. Looking at the context, there are four links: two about Kubernetes tags and cluster APIs, one on VCluster, and a Go repository for CosignWebhook.

The GitHub repo seems promising since it has a README.md file. That likely contains instructions or examples on how to use their code. I should look into that repo because they might have functions or methods designed to list pods.

I also recall that Kubernetes has an API called V1ResourceLoader which can be used to fetch all pods. The context mentions using the cluster API, so maybe there's a function in their Go code that utilizes this API under the hood.

Putting it together, I think the answer involves writing a Go program that uses the Kubernetes client library to list all pods. Since they provided a link to a GitHub repository with examples, I should suggest consulting that for detailed code snippets or functions.

I need to make sure my response is concise and follows the user's instructions: three sentences max, use " thanks!" at the end. So, I'll outline steps like using the client library, fetching pods, and referencing the provided resources.

To list all pods in a Kubernetes cluster using Go, you can utilize the `kubernetes` client library to fetch pod information from the Cluster API. The GitHub repository [grumpy](https://github.com/pipo02mix/grumpy) provides examples for interacting with Kubernetes APIs. Here's how you can proceed:

1. Use the Kubernetes client to fetch all pods in your cluster.
2. Iterate through the returned pods and process their details as needed.

This approach leverages existing resources like [CosignWebhook](https://github.com/eumel8/cosignwebhook) for handling Kubernetes operations programmatically. 

 thanks!
