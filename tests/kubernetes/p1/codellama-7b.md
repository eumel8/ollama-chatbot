You can use the following command to list all Pods in a Kubernetes cluster where the status is not "Running" or "Completed":
```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.status.phase}{"\n"}' | grep -v '^Running$' | grep -v '^Completed$'
```
This command uses the `kubectl get` command to retrieve a list of all Pods in the cluster, and the `--all-namespaces` flag to include Pods from all namespaces. The `-o jsonpath` option is used to specify a JSONPath expression that filters the output based on the Pod status. In this case, we are looking for Pods with a status that is not "Running" or "Completed".

The `grep -v` command is then used to filter out any lines that do not contain the string "Running" or "Completed", resulting in a list of all Pods with a non-running status.

Thanks for asking!
