Okay, I need to figure out how to list all Pods in a Kubernetes cluster using kubectl where their status isn't "Running" or "Completed". Let's start by recalling how kubectl commands work. 

I know that kubectl get pods can fetch pod information. But how do I filter based on status? From what I remember, the get command allows for filtering using options like --where. So maybe something like where(status != 'Running' && status != 'Completed').

Wait, but Kubernetes statuses include various possibilities beyond just these two. Also, some pods might have different states like 'Pending', 'Starting', etc. So by excluding "Running" and "Completed", I'm potentially missing other legitimate statuses. However, the user specifically wants only those not in those two, so that's okay.

Putting it all together, the command should be kubectl get pods --where='status != "Running" && status != "Completed"' --nohuge -n my-cluster. The --nohuge is optional but helps reduce output size. The namespace 'my-cluster' is assumed here; if needed, I can replace it with the actual one.

I think that should do it. Just run this command to list all pods not in those statuses.

To list all Kubernetes Pods with status not "Running" or "Completed", use `kubectl get pods --where='status != "Running" && status != "Completed"' --nohuge`. This filters out the specified statuses and displays remaining pods.

Thanks for asking!
