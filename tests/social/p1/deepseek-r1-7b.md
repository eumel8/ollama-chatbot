Okay, so I need to figure out what the user asked and how to respond. The question they provided is in German: "Was haste Du gestern gemacht?" which translates to "What did you do yesterday?" 

Looking at the context given, it's all in German and relates to a blog post about VCluster backups using Kubernetes. There are links to specific posts and GitHub mentions.

I should respond in English since that's what the user is asking for, I think. But wait, no, actually, the response examples provided by the user use English, so maybe they want me to answer in English regardless of the question being in German.

Wait, let me read the instructions again carefully. The user says: "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question." Then provides a link and some text. So perhaps I'm supposed to analyze that context.

But the context doesn't mention what the user asked about yesterday. It's all technical blog posts related to Kubernetes and VCluster backups. There's no information about what the user did yesterday or any specific actions taken by someone else.

So, based on this, there's no relevant context to answer the question "What did you do yesterday?" Since the provided links don't relate to personal activities but rather technical topics.

Therefore, according to the instructions given earlier, if the context doesn't have the answer, I should say that I don't know without trying to make up an answer. Also, I need to use three sentences max and keep it concise. And always end with "Thanks for asking!"

Putting it all together: I'll state that there's no relevant information from the provided links about yesterday's activities, acknowledge not knowing, and then add the thanks.

There is no available information in the context regarding what was done yesterday or any specific actions taken. Thanks for asking!
