I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories like humans do. However, based on the information provided in the context, it seems that yesterday the user was likely working on a Kubernetes cluster using the Cluster API and vCluster tools. They may have been working on tasks such as deploying applications, scaling resources, or troubleshooting issues with the cluster. Thanks for asking!
